1. The colspan="3" attribute means that the column spans three regular cell width i.e. 3 regular column width.

2. Different attributes: <br /> 
 * HTML attribute: align="center": it makes sure the text is aligned at the center.
 * CSS attributes: padding (for all <th>'s) and line-height (for everything in body). Padding makes sure we have 3pixel padding on each side and the line-height is making sure that the line height is a fixed number.
 
3. HTML sourse shows the whole html file, whereas the DOM inspector shows part of the html files and different CSS attribvutes. DOM inspector seems to be really useful to figure out part of the whole HTML file (and this is almost always the case). In that way it is more structued than the HTML source code viewer. However, if we want to see the source of the whole file then the HTML code viewer might be a better choice.<br />
In general, HTML source is the full version of all the html code and in DOM we can see the code in nicely formatted DOM tree-alike format, with css values and other elements.
